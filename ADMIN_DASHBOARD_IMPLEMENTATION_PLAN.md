# Admin Dashboard Implementation Plan

## üìã Executive Summary

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap to build a fully functional Admin Dashboard that integrates seamlessly with the existing API endpoints. The plan ensures **zero mock data or fallback logic** - all data will be sourced directly from the API as the single source of truth.

## üéØ Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Already Implemented
- **Content Management System**: Full CRUD for universities, study packs, units, modules, courses
- **Question Import System**: JSON-based bulk question import with validation
- **Basic Admin Layout**: Sidebar navigation, authentication guards, responsive design
- **Partial API Services**: User management, content management, basic analytics

### ‚ùå Missing Components
- **Dashboard Overview**: No main dashboard with statistics and analytics
- **User Management UI**: API exists but no interface
- **Quiz/Exam Management**: API exists but no admin interface
- **Subscription Management**: No UI for subscription CRUD operations
- **Revenue Analytics**: No revenue tracking interface
- **Question Reports**: No interface for managing user reports
- **File Upload UI**: API exists but no upload interface
